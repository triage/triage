# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Eric Schulte. Great to meet you.

## A little about me:
- Over 20 years in software engineering and leadership of full-stack teams
- Significant experience in early and growth-stage companies, from pre-seed to unicorn
- Deep knowledge of FinTech (Affirm, Fast, LearnVest, Clarity Money, YieldStreet, Cover)
- Staff-level mobile engineer (iOS: Swift + React Native, React)
- Published 8 apps to the App Store, 4 featured (ClassPass, LearnVest, Clarity Money, Grouper)
- Proficient in smart contract development (Solidity) due to early Ethereum adoption (2015)
- Truly enjoy programming, though having much fun building teams and growing engineers

## Currently:
- Developing my knowledge of AWS, Python, distributed systems

## Some fun side projects:
1. Stemming from an interest in diamonds and conflict minerals, I built an [Ethereum implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme back in 2017](https://github.com/triage/KPCSEthereum) to solve the issue of fraudulent certificates accompany rough diamond shipments.
2. While at ClassPass, [I built a decentralized booking platform for the studio fitness industry](https://github.com/triage/Jumbo)
3. I built a [SwiftUI app for tracking progressive overload](https://github.com/triage/Heavier)
