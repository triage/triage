# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Eric Schulte. Great to meet you.

- Significant experience in early and growth-stage companies, from pre-seed to unicorn
- Deep knowledge of FinTech (Affirm, Fast, LearnVest, Clarity Money, YieldStreet, Cover)

- Published 8 apps to the App Store, 4 featured (ClassPass, LearnVest, Clarity Money, Grouper)
- Proficient in smart contract development (Solidity) due to early Ethereum adoption (2015)
- Truly enjoy programming, though having much fun building teams and growing engineers

## Currently:
- Developing my knowledge of AWS, Python, distributed systems

## Some fun side projects:
1. Stemming from an interest in diamonds and conflict minerals, I built an [Ethereum implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (back in 2016)](https://github.com/triage/KPCSEthereum) to solve the issue of fraudulent certificates accompany rough diamond shipments.
2. While at ClassPass, [I built a decentralized booking platform for the studio fitness industry](https://github.com/triage/Jumbo)
3. I built a [SwiftUI app for tracking progressive overload](https://github.com/triage/Heavier)

## I have fun:
