# Hey there! 👋
I'm Eric Schulte. Great to meet you.

## A little about me:
- Software engineering and leadership of full-stack teams
- Significant experience in early and growth-stage companies, from pre-seed to unicorn
- Deep knowledge of FinTech (GoodLeap, Affirm, Fast, LearnVest, Clarity Money, YieldStreet, Cover)
- Staff mobile engineer (iOS: Swift + React Native, React)
- Truly enjoy programming, though having much fun building teams and growing engineers

## Currently:
- Mayor of Gas Town

## Some fun side projects:
1. Stemming from an interest in diamonds and conflict minerals, I built an [Ethereum implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (back in 2016)](https://github.com/triage/KPCSEthereum) to solve the issue of fraudulent certificates accompanying rough diamond shipments.
2. While at ClassPass, [I built a decentralized booking platform for the studio fitness industry](https://github.com/triage/Jumbo)
3. I built a [SwiftUI app for tracking progressive overload](https://github.com/triage/Heavier)

## I have fun:
